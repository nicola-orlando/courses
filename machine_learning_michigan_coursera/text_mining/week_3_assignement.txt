Question 2
Fit the training data X_train using a Count Vectorizer with default parameters.
What is the longest token in the vocabulary?
This function should return a string.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def answer_two():
    
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    tokens = vectorizer.get_feature_names()

Question 3
Fit and transform the training data X_train using a Count Vectorizer with default parameters.
Next, fit a fit a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier model with smoothing alpha=0.1. Find the area under the curve (AUC) score using the transformed test data.

    return output #Your answer here


Question 4
Fit and transform the training data X_train using a Tfidf Vectorizer with default parameters.

Put these features in a two series where each series is sorted by tf-idf value and then alphabetically by feature name. The index of the series should be the feature name, and the data should be the tf-idf.
The series of 20 features with smallest tf-idfs should be sorted smallest tfidf first, the list of 20 features with largest tf-idfs should be sorted largest first.
This function should return a tuple of two series (smallest tf-idfs series, largest tf-idfs series).

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import pandas as pd

    large_tf_idfs.sort_values('rank', ascending=False, inplace=True)
    
    # This is only a matter of formatting the output 
    small_tf_idfs.set_index('term')

def add_feature(X, feature_to_add):
    """
    Returns sparse feature matrix with added feature.
    feature_to_add can also be a list of features.
    """
    from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, hstack
    return hstack([X, csr_matrix(feature_to_add).T], 'csr')


Question 7
Fit and transform the training data X_train using a Tfidf Vectorizer ignoring terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than 5.

This function should return the AUC score as a float.


from sklearn.svm import SVC

def answer_seven():
    
    cls = SVC(C=10000)
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=5)
    X_vectorised = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_vectorised_new = add_feature(X_vectorised, X_train[:].str.len())

    output = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_predict)
    
    return  output #Your answer here

This function should return a tuple (average # digits not spam, average # digits spam).

def answer_eight():
    
    spam = spam_data[ spam_data['target']==1 ]
    not_spam = spam_data[ spam_data['target']==0 ]

    spam_average = spam['text'].str.count('\d').sum() / (spam.shape)[0]
    not_spam_average = not_spam['text'].str.count('\d').sum() / (not_spam.shape)[0]

    output = (not_spam_average,spam_average)
    
    return output #Your answer here


Question 9
Fit and transform the training data X_train using a Tfidf Vectorizer ignoring terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than 5 and using word n-grams from n=1 to n=3 (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).
Using this document-term matrix and the following additional features:
the length of document (number of characters)
number of digits per document
fit a Logistic Regression model with regularization C=100. Then compute the area under the curve (AUC) score using the transformed test data.
This function should return the AUC score as a float.


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def answer_nine():
    
    cls = LogisticRegression(C=100)
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=5,ngram_range=(1,3))
    X_vectorised = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_1_train = add_feature(X_vectorised, X_train[:].str.len())
    X_train_final = add_feature(X_1_train, X_train[:].str.count('\d')) 
    cls.fit(X_train_final, y_train)
    
    X_test_vectorised = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
    X_1_test = add_feature(X_test_vectorised, X_test[:].str.len())
    X_test_final = add_feature(X_1_test, X_test[:].str.count('\d')) 
    y_predict = cls.predict(X_test_final)
    output = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_predict)
    
    return output #Your answer here


Question 10
What is the average number of non-word characters (anything other than a letter, digit or underscore) per document for not spam and spam documents?
Hint: Use \w and \W character classes
This function should return a tuple (average # non-word characters not spam, average # non-word characters spam).


import re

def answer_ten():
    
    spam = spam_data[ spam_data['target']==1 ]
    not_spam = spam_data[ spam_data['target']==0 ]
    
    average_spam_not_word = spam['text'].str.count('\w').sum()  / (spam.shape)[0]
    average_not_spam_not_word = not_spam['text'].str.count('\w').sum()  / (not_spam.shape)[0]
    
    output = (average_not_spam_not_word  , average_spam_not_word)

    return output #Your answer here


Question 11
Fit and transform the training data X_train using a Count Vectorizer ignoring terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than 5 and using character n-grams from n=2 to n=5.
To tell Count Vectorizer to use character n-grams pass in analyzer='char_wb' which creates character n-grams only from text inside word boundaries. This should make the model more robust to spelling mistakes.
Using this document-term matrix and the following additional features:
the length of document (number of characters)
number of digits per document
number of non-word characters (anything other than a letter, digit or underscore.)
fit a Logistic Regression model with regularization C=100. Then compute the area under the curve (AUC) score using the transformed test data.
Also find the 10 smallest and 10 largest coefficients from the model and return them along with the AUC score in a tuple.
The list of 10 smallest coefficients should be sorted smallest first, the list of 10 largest coefficients should be sorted largest first.
The three features that were added to the document term matrix should have the following names should they appear in the list of coefficients: ['length_of_doc', 'digit_count', 'non_word_char_count']
This function should return a tuple (AUC score as a float, smallest coefs list, largest coefs list).

def answer_eleven():
    
    cls = LogisticRegression(C=100.)
    
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_df=5,ngram_range=(2,5), analyzer='char_wb')
    
    X_vectorised = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_1_train = add_feature(X_vectorised, X_train[:].str.len())
    X_2_train = add_feature(X_1_train, X_train[:].str.count('\d')) 
    X_train_final = add_feature(X_2_train, X_train[:].str.count('\w')) 
    
    X_test_vectorised = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
    X_1_test = add_feature(X_test_vectorised, X_test[:].str.len())
    X_2_test = add_feature(X_1_test, X_test[:].str.count('\d')) 
    X_test_final = add_feature(X_2_test, X_test[:].str.count('\w')) 
    
    cls.fit(X_train_final, y_train)
    y_predict = cls.predict(X_test_final)
    roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_predict)
    
    
    features = vectorizer.get_feature_names()
    sums = X_train_final.sum(axis=0)
    
    data = []
    for col, feature in enumerate(features):
        data.append( (feature, sums[0,col] ) ) 
    
    small_score_features = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['term','rank'])
    large_score_features = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['term','rank'])

    small_score_features.sort_values('rank', ascending=True, inplace=True)
    large_score_features.sort_values('rank', ascending=False, inplace=True)
    
    # This is only a matter of formatting the output 
    small_score_features.set_index('term')
    large_score_features.set_index('term')
    small_output = small_score_features['rank']
    large_output = large_score_features['rank']
    
    output =(roc,pd.Series(small_output[:10]),pd.Series(large_output[:10]))

    return output #Your answer here
